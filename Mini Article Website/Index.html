    <h1>Virtues of Ramadan</h1>

    <div>
        <h2>1. Enjoy the 'Outpourings' of Allah's mercy</h2>
        <p>The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: "Do good all
            the time, and seek to be recipients of the
            'outpouring' of Allah's mercy. Indeed, Allah
            showers down these (special) 'outpourings' of
            His mercy to whomsoever He wills from His
            slaves." (Tabarāni 719)
            
            Although Allah constantly showers His mercy,
            love and blessings upon us throughout the year,
            there are certain times of the year wherein He is
            even more Generous to us.
            
            These are the special seasons, days and
            
            moments in which it is even easier to acquire
            
            His pleasure, earn His forgiveness and be saved
            from the Hell-fire. The blessed month of
            Ramadãn is one such season when we witness
            the fruits of Allah's love and kindness.</p>

        <h2> 2. Ramadan Mubarak: Gates of Heaven & Hell </h2>
            <p>The Messenger of Allah ﷺ

                said: "The month of
                Ramadãn has come to you, a blessed month in
                which Allah -Exalted and Majestic is He - has
                obligated (its) fasting upon you. In it the gates of
                Paradise are opened, the gates of Hell-fire are
                closed, and the rebellious devils are chained. In
                it, Allah has a night which is better than a
                thousand months. Whoever is deprived of its
                good is truly deprived" (Nasāī 2106)
                
                "Some of the scholars said: This hadīth is the
                basis for congratulating one another for the
                arrival of Ramadān. Why shouldn't the believer
                be congratulated when the gates of Paradise
                have opened? Why shouldn't the sinner be
                congratulated when the gates of the Hell-fire
                have closed? Why shouldn't the intelligent be
                congratulated for a time when the devils are
                chained? How can this time be compared to any
                other time?" (Ibn Rajab)</p>

        <h2>3. 'O seeker of good, come
            forward! O seeker of evil, stop!"'
            </h2>
            <p>The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: "When it is the
                first night of the month of Ramadān, the devils
                and the rebellious jinn are tied up; the doors of
                Hell-fire are closed, and none of its doors are
                opened. The doors of Paradise are opened, and
                none of its doors are closed. A caller calls out: '0
                seeker of good, come forward! O seeker of evil,
                stop!' And every night, Allah frees slaves from
                the Hell-fire." (Tirmidhī 682)
                <br>
                'By Allah, if it was said to the people of the
                grave, 'make a wish! they would wish for
                one day of Ramadãn.' (lbn al-Jawzī)
                <br>
                Ramadān is short, so let us not shorten it
                further with our negligence. Use it wisely</p>
    </div>

        <h2>4. Be Forgiven From Ramadan to Ramadan</h2>
        <p>The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: “The five daily prayers, Jumuʿah to Jumuʿah, and Ramaḍān to Ramaḍān expiate for (the sins perpetrated) in between them, so long as one stays away from the major sins.” (Muslim 233c) <br>
            “Whoever’s Jumuʿah is safe from evil, his week will be safe from evil. Whoever’s Ramaḍān is safe from evil, his year will be safe from evil. Whoever’s ḥajj is safe from evil, his life will be safe from evil.” (Ibn al-Qayyim)
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>5. Know This is The Month of Qur’an</h2>
        <p>
            Ramadãn is the month for reciting the Qur’an.
            Allah says: <br>
            شَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ ٱلَّذِىٓ أُنزِلَ فِيهِ ٱلْقُرْءَانُ هُدًى لِّلنَّاسِ وَبَيِّنَـٰتٍ مِّنَ ٱلْهُدَىٰ وَٱلْفُرْقَان<br>
            “Ramaḍān is the month in which the Qur’ān was revealed – a guidance for mankind, and clear proofs of the guidance, and the criterion (between right and wrong)…” (2:185)
            <br>
            The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: “The scriptures of Ibrāhīm were revealed on the first night of Ramaḍān. The Torah was revealed after six nights of Ramaḍān had passed. The Gospel was revealed after thirteen nights of Ramaḍān had passed. The Qur’ān was revealed after twenty-four nights of Ramaḍān had passed.” (Aḥmad 16984)
